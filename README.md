# reverso.net-API
An offical API for reverso.net translations. ready to deploy into heroku webservices.

# Live Test
go to https://reverso-api.herokuapp.com/translate/?source=en&lang=ar&word=historical<br /> 
`source` => the source language.<br /> 
`lang` => the language that we want to translate to.<br /> 
`word` => word to translate.<br /> 

# Usage
the only thing to do is to install requirements typing:<br /> 
`pip install requirements.txt`<br /> 
<br />

this API unfortunately can't translate more than one word.
